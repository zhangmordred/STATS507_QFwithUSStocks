# STATS507_QFwithUSStocks

This is the project of STATS 507, Umich.

## Data collection
The training and backtesting data are collected from [Stocks-Daily-Price](https://huggingface.co/datasets/paperswithbacktest/Stocks-Daily-Price) and [Stocks-BalanceSheet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/paperswithbacktest/Stocks-Quarterly-BalanceSheet) from 2010 to 2024. For each stock, the **adjusted** cumulated return and cumulated turnover rate in the setting timestamp will be collected (if training model by return directly, the result may be influenced).

## Model implementation
The model is run in Python 3.8.3 (64-bit), torch version is 2.1.0+cpu and numpy version is 1.23.1. We are not sure if it will work properly under a lower version.

## Backtest
### Trading strategy
Before the first trade date of the timestamp $t$, all sequences $\mathcal{X}^{t} _{n}$ from the stock set $S^t$ are put in the model and the list of outputs $\hat{Y}^t$ is required. The portfolio value at time $t$, denoted as $P^t$ is updated based on the previous periodâ€™s weights and returns as follows:
\begin{equation}
P^t = P^{t-1} (\sum^N_{n=1} w^{t-1}_n (1 + r^{t-1}_n))
\label{valueofstrategy}
\end{equation}
where $w^t_n$ is the weight of stock $s^t_n$ and $r^t_n$ is the return of the stock and $\sum^N_{n=1} w^t_n = 1$. To determine the weight of each stock, a trading strategy $\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{\varrho}$ and the decision factor $\mathbf{b}$ is used at the strategy, where $\mathbf{b}$ determines how many quantile groups are selected, satisfying $ 1 \leq \mathbf{b} < \varrho$. The strategy does not allow short-sell, so $\Phi$ only contains $0$ and $1$. 
$$
\Phi \in \{0,1\}^{\varrho}, \quad ||\Phi||_0 = \mathbf{b}
$$
For example: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $\varrho = 3$, $\mathbf{b} = 1$, then $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ could be one of: $[1, 0, 0]$, $[0, 1, 0]$, or $[0, 0, 1]$.
    \item If $\mathbf{b} = 2$, then possible values of $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ include: $[1, 1, 0]$, $[1, 0, 1]$, or $[0, 1, 1]$.
\end{itemize}
Recall the predicted output $\hat{y}^t_n = \{ \hat{y}^t_{n,i} \}^{\varrho}_{i=1}$, we sort $S^t$ by $\Psi(\hat{y}^t_{n,1})$, which is the empirical quantile CDF for $\hat{y}^t_{n,1}$. Similar to (\ref{empirical quantile }), $\Psi(\hat{y}^t_{n,1})$ is computed in this way:
\begin{equation}
\Psi(\hat{y}^t_{n,1}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} \mathbf{1}_{\{\hat{y}^t_{i,1} \leq \hat{y}^t_{n,1} \}}
\label{empirical quantile_y}
\end{equation}
The sorted predicted vector $\tilde{y}^t_n$ for stock $s^t_n$ at time t is shown below.Here the stocks are ranked into $\varrho$ parts and each part contains $\varphi \times100\%$ of the stocks, and the parameters $\varrho$ and $\varphi$ satisfy $\varphi\varrho \leq 1$:
$$
    \tilde{y}^t_n =[\mathbf{1}_{\{ (i-1)(\varrho+\xi) \leq \Psi(\hat{y}^t_{n,1}) < i\varrho\ + (i-1)\xi)}  \vert i = 1, \dots, \varrho] \in \mathbb{R}^{\varrho}
$$
Then the weight for each selected stock is computed by (\ref{weight}) shown below, and all the chosen stocks are equal-weighted in this way:
\begin{equation}
w^t_n = \frac{1}{\mathbf{b} \cdot \varrho } (\tilde{y}^{t-1}_n  \Phi^T  \tilde{y}^t_n )^T \cdot \mathbf{1}
\label{weight}
\end{equation} 
The backtest starts from January 2020, in other words, the result of the sequences from May 2018 to December 2019 will be used as the first stock pool to trade.
